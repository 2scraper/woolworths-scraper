diff_runs.py
-------------
Compares two output files from this project (JSON, as written by
output_writer.save) and reports what changed between them, keyed on `sku` —
the identifier the README tells people to diff on for tracking an answer's
reception over time.

    python3 diff_runs.py --old ml.2026-09-01.json \\
                          --new ml.2026-09-07.json

Typical use is a scheduled re-run of one of the engines, kept under a dated
filename, diffed against the previous one:

    python3 playwright_scraper.py --url "$URL" --out "ml_$(date +%F)"
    python3 diff_runs.py --old "ml_$(ls -t ml_*.json | sed -n 2p)" \\
                          --new "ml_$(date +%F).json" --out diff.json

Four buckets, each keyed on sku — here the answer's permalink:

  added          — sku present in --new, absent from --old
  removed        — sku present in --old, absent from --new (deleted or
                   collapsed, or just off this particular feed run)
  changed        — sku present in both, with a different clap count, response
                   count, answer count, title or body length
  source_changed — sku present in both with a different count, but also a
                   different `data_source`. That is the bucket this site
                   needs most: claps, responses, reading time and the full
                   reading time and word count come from the view that
                   built the row and are
                   NULL on a row built from the rendered card alone, so a
                   topic run diffed against a question run would report every
                   count as having appeared or vanished. Reported separately
                   because it says something about our own two snapshots, not
                   about the site — and --fail-on-change deliberately ignores
                   it.

An answer this project's parser could not recover a sku for (None) cannot be
matched across runs at all, so it is counted and reported separately rather
than silently folded into "added"/"removed", which would be wrong on its face.
